# RSpec-guard-spork Boilerplate

A boilerplate project template for Ruby to kickstart behaviour-driven development using RSpec.

I prefer guard to autotest/autospec.  It's file watcher is easily configured and very versatile.  Running spork in the background speeds up the testing process even more.

# Installation

Just install the bundles:

    bundle install

# Start guard

Simply type

    guard
    
and there you are.
